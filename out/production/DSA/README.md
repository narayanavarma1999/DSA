1. Arrays
   - It is a collection of similar elements which are stored in continous memory manner
     Accessing - O(1)
     Insert - O(1)/O(n)
     Delete - O(1)/O(n)
     Traverse - O(n)
     Search - Linear Search - O(n), Binary Search - O(logN)
     Update - O(1)

Advantages of Arrays:

1. Easily Accessing the elements - O(1)
2. Cache Friendly
3. Ease for sorting
4. Implement other Data Structures

Limitations:

1. Fixed value of size
2. InEfficient for frequent modifications like insert/deletion.
